TODO:
	* Import of "popular" and recent appraisals, a legacy "/e/<id>" endpoint to handle translating of IDs will be needed
	* Price blueprint copies properly (or at least fail to price them)
	* Database backups

	- Automatic deletion of appraisals which hasn't been visted in a long time
	- Blueprint copy prices
	-  Price breakdown page for each item. Why is it currently priced a certain way? This will be important for capital ships and BPOs and just give a good breakdown of prices per region
