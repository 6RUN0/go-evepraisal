TODO:
	* Re-use/save market preference
	* Add perma-link
	* Import of "popular" and recent appraisals (partially done)
	* Database backups (through local management HTTP API)

	- Blueprint copy prices
	- Price breakdown page for each item. Why is it currently priced a certain way? This will be important for capital ships and BPOs and just give a good breakdown of prices per region
