	Componentized prices (for capital ships)
	Blueprint copy prices

	App telemetry (new relic)
	Google Analytics

	 - Import of "popular" and recent appraisals, a legacy "/e/<id>" endpoint to handle translating of IDs will be needed
	 - Automatic deletion of appraisals which hasn't been visted in a long time
