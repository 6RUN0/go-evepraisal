    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    <p>
      Evepraisal is a tool for quickly getting bulk estimates of items from Eve Online.
    </p>
    <h4>How does this work?</h4>
    <p>
       Find something in Eve Online that you want to price check like a contract, cargo scan result, etc. Press <strong>CTRL + A, CTRL + C</strong>, then click on the lovely box to the left or above this and press <strong>CTRL + V</strong>. Submit and you should see a price breakdown of all the items.
    </p>

    <h4>What all can I paste in there?</h4>
    <p>At first, this started as a simple cargo scan estimator but over time more formats have been added to the parser so you can use it as a more general price checker. Currently the following formats are supported:</p>
